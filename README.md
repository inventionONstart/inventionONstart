Hi I'm Sol!
Im in the process of learning scripting/programming. 
Right now, im not lookng to collab. So please leave yur pull requests to someone else instead.
Im a minor. PLease keep that in mind. I am a young developer and i will not be looking for a big project or joining a company. 
I am using this place as practice and to create cool stuff! Feel free to check this stuff out! Treat this like your arts and crafts doodle box for viewing!
I am currently working on html. But i am intrested in Python, Java, and Lua.
